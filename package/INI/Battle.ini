LongDescription=In 1946, Albert Einstein used his Chronosphere device to go back in time, and forever alter history.@Einstein's good intentions however, upset the delicate balance of world powers, allowing Joseph Stalin to lead communist Russia in a major invasion of Europe.@Initially, the Soviet invasion was successful, and soon it appeared that the British will be the last free people in Europe.@But the European allies rallied, eventually smashing the communist war machine.@With Stalin's defeat, this man, Alexander Romanov, came to power with the blessing of Allied commanders.@Although an aristocrat and a member of the Communist Party, Romanov was an advocate of peace.@Current satellite intelligence indicates that Romanov may not be acting in good faith.@Soviet warships have been spotted, moving at high speed into the Atlantic.@This man, known only as "Yuri", may be responsible for shutting down our entire covert intelligence network in the Soviet Union.@Ever since Yuri became Romanov's chief advisor, relations with the Soviet Union have deteriorated, our in-country agents are missing, some have been seen collaborating with KGB operatives.@We need to prepare for the worst, Commander - war with the Soviets.
