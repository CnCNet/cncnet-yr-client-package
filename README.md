### Development

**NOTE:** This is NOT the repository necessary for developing the CNCET client for Yuri's revenge. That is the **XNA CnCNet Client** mentioned above. This is simply a wrapper for it.

To contribute to the XNA client for YR, you must also check out the `xna-cncnet-client` repo mentioned above. Once that repo is checked out, you can copy and paste the `Directory.Build.Game.YR.props` file located into the root of the `xna-cncnet-client` checkout location. This file should automatically copy over all necessary resources from this repository to the output directory of the compiled `xna-cncnet-client` executable. Then, when launched, it should do so with with the Yuri's revenge theme.

You MUST edit the `YRSource` property in the `Directory.Build.Game.YR.props` file if you use it.
