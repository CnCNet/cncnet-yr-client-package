### Development

**NOTE:** This is NOT the repository necessary for developing the CNCNET client for Yuri's revenge. That is the **XNA CnCNet Client** mentioned above. This is simply a wrapper for it.

To contribute to the XNA client for YR, you must also check out the `xna-cncnet-client` repo mentioned above. Once that repo is checked out, you can copy and paste the `Directory.Build.Game.YR.props` file located into the root of the `xna-cncnet-client` checkout location. This file should automatically copy over all necessary resources from this repository to the output directory of the compiled `xna-cncnet-client` executable. Then, when launched, it should do so with with the Yuri's revenge theme.

You MUST edit the `YRSource` property in the `Directory.Build.Game.YR.props` file if you use it.

### Repository Structure

- `package` - This directory contains the exact file structure that should make up the client package that is delivered to users.
- `resources` - This directory contains any resources to assist in building the package, like other theming elements. For example, this directory contains various `expandspawn09.mix` files for custom crates. These `mix` files can be moved to the `package` directory when we want to change the crate theme.
- `tools` - This directory contains tools that are used to help build the package. It includes tools like:
  - `download-artifacts/download-client.ps1` - A powershell script to automatically download a specific set of binaries of the `xna-cncnet-client`
  - `download-artifacts/download-client-launcher.ps1` - A powershell script to automatically download a specific instance of the client launcher.
  - `inno-setup/inno-setup.ps1` - A powershell script to build the InnoSetup installer
  - `maps-updater/maps-updater.ps1` - A powershell script that is basically a wrapper to run our YRMapsUpdater C# program. This program updates the mpmaps.ini file by scanning for all map changes in the `package/Maps/Yuri's Revenge` directory.
