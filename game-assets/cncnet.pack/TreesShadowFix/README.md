### Description

```
Nothing huge really, just the trees from the unmodified game with duplicated frames to prevent the shadow from appearing as 'damaged artwork' (you might've noticed the cyan blobs sometimes appearing where a tree was previously standing) for all theaters, including some extra trees like the dead ones from desert for theaters like temperate and urban.

Credit is not necessary but can do that if you feel like it.
